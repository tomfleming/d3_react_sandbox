Can D3 and React play nice?
===========================

Tinkering with D3 and React together... concept based on:

* http://jkaufman.io/react-d3-love/
* https://github.com/kauffecup/react-bubble-chart

So far no library conflicts, promising approach. To get re-started on the
tinerking, install the node modules and webpack up...

```
npm install
webpack
```

If you get a webpack error, either make sure it's installed globally...

```
npm install -g webpack
webpack
```

Or use the locally installed copy...

```
node_modles/.bin/webpack
```
